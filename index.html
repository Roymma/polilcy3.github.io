<p>10.Protection of Minors </p>
<p>We attach great importance to the protection of minors’ personal information, and we will keep exploring new ways to protect minors’ personal information. </p>

<p>We will protect the legitimate rights and interests of minors by initiating anti-addiction system in accordance with relevant regulations on online game anti-addiction policies. We will make a judgment on whether the real name information of an account belongs to a minor via the identification result of information such as real-name identity, based on which we decide whether the account shall be included in the anti-addiction system. In addition, we will collect information such as your login time, length of playing games, etc., and guide the minors to play games rationally through ways such as automatically intervening and limiting the game duration of the minors in our system, enabling the function of mandatorily exiting the game, etc. When the consumption is conducted by a person suspected to be a minor, we will then try to contact his or her parent or legal guardian for reminders, confirmations and deposition, so as to help the minors have a healthy access to the Internet.</p> 

<p>At the same time, in order to better protect both the physical and mental health of minors and facilitate a healthy access to the Internet for them, we may employ stricter anti-addiction measures on the basis of relevant anti-addiction policies related to online games. Further, we will keep conducting researches and testing various technologies to protect the minors. For example, in order to further improve the accuracy of real-name verification on identities and to try best to prevent minors from impersonating the identity of others, we may enable face-recognition verifications in some games or for some users (subject to specific game strategies) under specific situations (for example, when you log into a game, or when you top up, purchase or make transactions during the game). </p>

<p>Besides, we may also collect your game behavior data generated during the game (for example, the data such as the click pressure and radius, the relative position of the click, the acceleration direction, and the direction of gravity formed when you operate the game on the terminal device, and the voice data generated when you interact with other players through online voice in the game) to preliminarily determine whether the user is a minor (regarding the voice data, the system will only randomly use some of your online voice to judge whether it is from a child or an adult). If the preliminary determination shows you are a minor, we may enable the face-recognition verification in accordance with the foregoing prescriptions. </p>

<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, please pay attention to whether the minor uses Pinoy Game Hub Service or provides his or her personal information after obtaining your authorization and approval. If you have questions about the personal information of the minor under your guardian, please contact us through the contact details provided in Section 9 herein. </p>

<p>11. Contact Us </p>
<p>When you have other complaints, suggestions, or questions regarding personal information of minors, please contact us. </p>

<p>We will review the relevant questions as soon as possible, and will respond within 15 days upon verifying your user identity.</p>
